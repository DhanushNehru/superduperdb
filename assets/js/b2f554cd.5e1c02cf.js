Worse, you can\u2019t just pass a data store connection to such a library, and tell the library to use the connection to train the model: you have to write more custom code.\\n\\nThere is no general Python abstraction bringing self-built models like PyTorch, models imported from libraries like Scikit-Learn, and models hosted behind APIs like OpenAI, together under one roof with existing data stores: even more custom code.\\n\\nThe result is that developers still must perform considerable coding to connect AI models with their data stores.\\n\\n### Vector databases mean data fragmentation and difficulties with data-lineage\\n\\nA vector database is powerful but leaves architects and developers with questions:\\n\\n- Should all data now live in the vector database?\\n- Should the vector database only contain vectors?\\n\\nIdeally, data would stay in the primary datastore, but many datastores do not have a vector search implementation.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is problematic to make the vector database the primary datastore for an application, as most vector databases lack the specialized features of classical relational databases or document stores, and offer few consistency or performance guarantees.\\n\\n### Connect models and datastores with SuperDuperDB\\n\\n- SuperDuperDB is a framework which wraps data stores and AI models, with minimal boilerplate code.\\n- Arbitrary models from open-source are applied directly to datastore queries and the outputs can be saved right back in the datastore, keeping everything in one location. Computations scale using the rich and diverse tools in the PyData ecosystem.\\n- SuperDuperDB allows complex data types as inputs to AI models, such as images, audio and beyond.\\n- SuperDuperDB can instantly make a classical database or data store vector-searchable. SuperDuperDB wraps well-known query APIs with additional commands for vector search, and takes care of organizing the results into a consistent result set for databases without a native vector-search implementation.\\n- SuperDuperDB can use a query to train models directly on the data store. The fully open-source SuperDuperDB environment provides a scalable and serverless developer experience for model training.\\n\\n### Get started easily, and go far\\n\\nSuperDuperDB is designed to make it as simple as possible to get started. For example, to connect with SuperDuperDB using MongoDB and Python, just type:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom superduperdb import superduper\\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\\n\\ndb = MongoClient().my_database\\ndb = superduper(db)\\n```\\n\\nAt the same time, SuperDuperDB is ready for the full range of modern AI tools. It scales horizontally and includes a flexible approach allowing arbitrary AI frameworks to be used together, including torch, transformers, sklearn and openai.\\n\\n- GitHub: https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduperdb\\n- Docs: https://docs.superduperdb.com\\n- Blog: https://www.superduperdb.com/blog\\n\\n### The road ahead\\n\\nIn the weeks and months to come we\u2019ll be:\\n\\n- Adding SQL support (already close to completion)\\n- Building bridges to more AI frameworks, libraries, models and API services\\n- Creating tools to manage a SuperDuperDB deployment in production\\n\\n### Contributors are welcome!\\n\\nSuperDuperDB comes with the Apache 2.0 license.

This means that the database environment also has access to some compute and AI models, or access to APIs such as OpenAI, in order to obtain vectors.\\n\\nExamples of this approach are:\\n\\n- Weaviate (support for a range of pre-defined models, some support for bringing own model)\\n- Chroma (support for OpenAI and sentence_transformers)\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- The data and compute live together, so developers don\u2019t need to create an additional app in order to use the vector-database\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Developers are limited by the models available in the vector-database and the compute resources on the vector-database server\\n- Primary data needs to be stored in the vector-database; classic-database + external vector-search isn\u2019t an expected pattern.\\n- Training of models is generally not supported.\\n\\n** Possibility 2: the vector-database requires developers to provide their own vectors with their own models **\\n\\nIn this approach, developers are required to build an app which deploys model computations over data which is extracted from the datastore.\\n\\nExamples of this approach are:\\n\\n- LanceDB\\n- Milvus\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- By developing a vector-computation app, the user can use the full flexibility of the open-source landscape for computing these vectors, and can architect compute resources independently from vector-database resources\\n- The vector-database \u201cspecializes\u201d in vector-search and storage of vectors, giving better performance guarantees as a result\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Huge overhead of building one\u2019s own computation app.\\n- All communication between app, vector-database and datastore (if using external datastore) must be managed by the developer\\n\\n### Enter SuperDuperDB\\n\\nSuperDuperDB is a middle path to scalability, flexiblity and ease-of-use in vector-search and far beyond.\\n\\n- SuperDuperDB is an open-source Python environment which wraps databases and AI models with additional functionality to make them \u201cready\u201d to interface with one-another; developers are able to host their data in a \u201cclassical\u201d database, but use this database as a vector-database.\\n- SuperDuperDB allows users to integrate any model from the Python open source ecosystem (torch, sklearn, transformers, sentence_transformers as well as OpenAI\u2019s API), with their datastore. It uses a flexible scheme, allowing new frameworks and code-bases to be integrated without requiring the developer to add additional classes or functionality.\\n- SuperDuperDB can be co-located with the database in infrastructure, but at the same time has access to its own compute, which is scalable. This makes it vertically performant and at the same time, ready to scale horizontally to accommodate larger usage.\\n- SuperDuperDB enables training directly with the datastore: developers are only required to specify a database-query to initiate training on scalable compute.\\n- Developers are not required to program tricky boilerplate code or architectures for computing vector outputs and storing these back in the database. This is all supported natively by SuperDuperDB.\\n- SuperDuperDB supports data of arbitrary type: with its flexible serialization model, SuperDuperDB can handle text, images, tensors, audio and beyond.\\n- SuperDuperDB\u2019s scope goes far beyond vector-search; it supports models with arbitrary outputs: classification, generative AI, fore-casting and much more are all within scope and supported. This allows users to build interdependent models, where base models feed their outputs into downstream models; this enables transfer learning, and quality assurance via classification on generated outputs, to name but 2 key outcomes of SuperDuperDB\u2019s integration model.\\n\\n### Minimal boilerplate to connect to SuperDuperDB\\n\\nConnecting to MongoDB with SuperDuperDB is super easy. The connection may be used to insert documents, although insertion/ ingestion can also proceed via other sources/ client libraries.\\n\\n```python\\nimport json\\nimport pymongo\\n\\nfrom superduperdb import superduper\\nfrom superduperdb.container.document import Document\\nfrom superduperdb.db.mongodb.query import Collection\\n\\ndb = pymongo.MongoClient().documents\\ndb = superduper(db)\\n\\ncollection = Collection(\'wikipedia\')\\n\\nwith open(\'wikipedia.json\') as f:\\n    data = json.load(f)\\n\\ndb.execute(\\n    collection.insert_many([Document(r) for r in data])\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Set up vector-search with SuperDuperDB in one command\\n\\n```python\\nfrom superduperdb.container.vector_index import VectorIndex\\nfrom superduperdb.container.listener import Listener\\nfrom superduperdb.ext.numpy.array import array\\nfrom superduperdb.ext.openai import OpenAIEmbedding\\n\\ndb.add(\\n    VectorIndex(\\n        identifier=f\'wiki-index\',\\n        indexing_listener=Listener(\\n            model=OpenAIEmbedding(model=\'text-embedding-ada-002\'),\\n            key=\'abstract\',\\n            select=collection.find(),\\n            predict_kwargs={\'max_chunk_size\': 1000},\\n        )\\n    )\\n)\\n```\\n\\nThis approach is simple enough to allow models from a vast range of libraries and sources to be implemented: open/ closed source, self-built or library based and much more.\\n\\nNow that the index has been created, queries may be dispatched in a new session to SuperDuperDB without reloading the model:\\n\\n```python\\ncur = db.execute(\\n    collection\\n        .like({\'title\': \'articles about sport\'}, n=10, vector_index=f\'wiki-index\')\\n        .find({}, {\'title\': 1})\\n)\\n\\nfor r in cur:\\n    print(r)\\n```\\n\\nThe great thing about using MongoDB or a similar battle tested database for vector-search, is that it can be easily combined with important filtering approaches. In this query, we restrict the results to a hard match involving the word \u201cAustralia\u201d:\\n\\n```python\\ncur = db.execute(\\n    collection\\n        .like({\'title\': \'articles about sport\'}, n=100, vector_index=f\'wiki-index-{model.identifier}\')\\n        .find({\'title\': {\'$regex\': \'.*Australia\'}})\\n)\\n\\nfor r in cur:\\n    print(r[\'title\'])\\n```\\n\\n### SuperDuperDB is licensed under Apache 2.0 and is a community effort!\\n\\nWe would like to encourage developers interested in the project to contribute in our discussion forums, issue boards and by making their own pull requests.
